# SCT_DS_2
Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Titanic dataset as part of internship task.
This project is part of my **Data Science Internship Task 2**, where I perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis on the famous Titanic dataset from Kaggle.

---

## 📌 Objective

Explore the Titanic dataset to:

- Clean and handle missing data
- Visualize survival patterns
- Understand relationships between variables

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Steps

- Handled missing values (`Age`, `Embarked`)
- Dropped `Cabin` due to high missingness
- Checked data types and basic statistics

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Survival distribution
- Analysis based on:
  - Gender
  - Passenger Class
  - Age
  - Family aboard (SibSp, Parch)

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- **Women** and **1st class** passengers had higher survival rates.
- **Children** (younger passengers) were more likely to survive.
- Fare correlated with class.
- Some influence from family size.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
